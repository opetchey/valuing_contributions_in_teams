This little app is for helping report on individual contributions in teams. Contributions are according to the [CRediT â€“ Contributor Roles Taxonomy](https://casrai.org/credit/).

1. Make a copy of [the google spreadsheet here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hfpQblHZeAKTDYqYSvOw2E6eQ__Vp-n_NsOjcosfG5Y).
2. Fill in your project and team information, replacing anything you need to. You and your team can update this information as your project progresses.
3. [Publish your googlesheet](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/183965).
3. Get a shareable link to your googlesheet. 
4. Paste the shareable link in the dialog box below left.
5. The app will the produce text that can be used in reporting (e.g. as the author contribution statement that many journals now request.)

Note that if lots of people attempt use this app using the default googlesheet then google may limit access to the default googlesheet. If this occurs, try going through steps 1, 3, 4 above.
